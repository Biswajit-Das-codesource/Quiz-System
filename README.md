🔄 Password Recovery System:

Forgot Password: Users can recover their login details by verifying their phone number if they forget their password.
📊 Score Management:<br>

Score Tracking: Users can view their scores after completing the quiz.<br>
Technical Details:
Programming Language: Python<br>
Data Structures Used:<br>
Dictionaries: For storing user data and scores.<br>
Lists: For managing passwords and usernames.<br>
Control Flow:<br>
Conditional Statements: For verifying user input and handling different scenarios (e.g., incorrect passwords, registration conflicts).<br>
Loops: For maintaining the application flow and enabling continuous interaction.<br>
This project demonstrates my ability to create a user-friendly application with essential features such as secure authentication and interactive testing. It’s been a great way to apply my skills in Python and develop a practical solution for managing quizzes and user data.

🚀 Introducing My Interactive Quiz Application with Comprehensive Features 📚

I’m excited to showcase my latest project—a dynamic quiz application that incorporates several key functionalities:

🔐 User Registration & Secure Login:

Registration: Users can sign up by providing their name, school, phone number, and a secure password.
Login System: Users log in with their registered credentials to access the quiz.
📝 Interactive Quiz:

Questions & Answers: The quiz covers fundamental web technologies with questions about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Scoring: Real-time scoring as users answer questions correctly.
🔄 Password Recovery System:

Forgot Password: Users can recover their login details by verifying their phone number if they forget their password.
📊 Score Management:

Score Tracking: Users can view their scores after completing the quiz.
Technical Details:
Programming Language: Python
Data Structures Used:
Dictionaries: For storing user data and scores.
Lists: For managing passwords and usernames.
Control Flow:
Conditional Statements: For verifying user input and handling different scenarios (e.g., incorrect passwords, registration conflicts).
Loops: For maintaining the application flow and enabling continuous interaction.
This project demonstrates my ability to create a user-friendly application with essential features such as secure authentication and interactive testing. It’s been a great way to apply my skills in Python and develop a practical solution for managing quizzes and user data.

Feel free to check out the code and let me know your feedback!
